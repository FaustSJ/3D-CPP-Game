Directions:
--You play as a barrel (the rusty looking circle) and in order to move you must
rotate the map and use gravity.
--Rotate the map using the left and right arrow keys
--reset a level or close textboxes by pressing [Enter]

Are the requirements met:
--My game has three levels, each of which are loaded from a text file.
--Physics and collision are used in navigating the barrel around the map.
--The enemies (being sinbads) are fully animated.
--The enemies use A* to travel their fixed paths. A* is recalculated each time they reach
a path end.
--"chance" is used in the last level, where the goal may or may not move to a new location
every few seconds or so.
--As for the three game states, the game has at least two: one where the goal is stationary
and one where the goal moves itself. I meant to add a third state that altered the enemies
paths toward the player, but but did not set aside enough time to do so.

NOTE:
I had to record my game through my phone because my computer is having technical problems
and isn't able to record video through screen-capture.
